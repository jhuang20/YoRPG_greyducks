# YoRPG_greyducks
team greyducks' epic rpg :)

James Huang, Addison Huang, Frank Chen
--- PLAN --- 
1) ATTEMPT TO FIX THE NAME BUG(Addison did this)

2) Add functionality to YoRPG so that one can choose a "companion" weapon to augment attack//defense strength
...or maybe, a health potion??

If we have time:

3) Make it so that you can increase attack strength by taking a health hit
-------------------------------------

Welcome to Ye Olde Role Playing Game! Thou art a protagonist and thou must fighteth ye monsters. Thou may choose to be an archer, knight, or mage. Archers art ranged and have high attack but lack defense and health. Knights art clad in shining armor, ready to save any princess or slay any monster. They are high in health and defense but lack in damage. Mages are similar to archers but they lack in attack rate. I wish thou a good luck on ye olde quest to beat ye olde RPG!  

THE CHARACTERS:
the good guys(our protagonist):
Archer- 
SYNOPSIS: What the archer lacks in health, he makes up in skill. With his bow he can attack at twice the rate of a knight while dealing a relatively high amount of damage. Attack monsters with confidence, but caution.

Knight-
SYNOPSIS: The Knight is powerful and healthy, with his shiny plated metal armor providing a formidable defense. His lance deals heavy damage, but he is slow. A consistent protagonist who's solid all around

Mage-
SYNOPSIS: The Mage, short for magician, may be weak on the outside, but one cannot underestimate the fury he can unleash. With his wand he can conjure powerful offensive spells, albeit at a slow rate. His offensive power is his shining point, but attack wisely, for his defense and health are painfully low.

the bad guys(our MONSTERS):
Dragon-
SYNOPSIS: a most formidable opponent. The dragon is more powerful than you, and can attack you with a rain of painful and debilitating fire. Don't try to attack him either; his scales make his skin inpenetrable. 

Goblin-
SYNOPSIS: sneaky, but more of a nuisance than an actual monster. He can deal damage, but for mostly any protagonist it won't do more than give you a few bruises. 

Giant-
SYNOPSIS: he lumbers slowly, looming over your character like a shadow. When he strikes he attacks with the force of what one could only describe as a painful blow. He's hard to fight, but his size can be used to your advantage because of your superior speed.
